\section*{General Introduction}


{\bf [WHEN PEOPLE COME IN THE SCREEN GIVES A WELCOME MESSAGE. WHEN
  EVERYBODY IS READY ALLEN WILL START THE GAME]}\\

Welcome, I am Dr. Anderies, a professor here at ASU and we will conduct a
decision-making exercise today. Allen Lee will assist me during the
exercise. Before we go to the instructions,  I will ask you to turn
off any mobile phones and other mobile devices that might  disrupt
the exercise. I also ask that you not speak during the exercise. If
you have a question, raise your hand, and I will address your
question.\\

This exercise consists of two practice rounds and twenty rounds for
real. Each round is about two minutes.\\

\noindent{\bf [TELL ALLEN: START INSTRUCTION SCREEN]}\\

Carefully read the instructions on the screen. Because it is important
for the results that you understand the instructions, I will also read
the instructions out loud.  You will be able to earn money in this
exercise based on the decisions you are making and the decisions the
participants in your group are making.

\newpage

\section{General Instructions} 


You have already earned 5 dollars by showing up for this exercise. You
can earn more, up to an extra 30 dollars. \\

You will participate in this exercise as a part of a group of five
participants. Your group has been formed by randomly assigning you to
FOUR other participants in
the room.\\

The amount of money you earn will depend on the decisions made by you
and the other members of your group.\\

This exercise mimics decisions people make in irrigation systems. \\

In each round you will receive 10 tokens which you can invest in the
irrigation infrastructure. Based on the water delivery capacity of the
irrigation infrastructure and the availability of water you will be able to grow crops. \\

Tokens earned in a round is the sum of tokens not invested plus tokens
earned by growing crops. Each token is worth 5 cents. \\

In each round you will first decide how much to invest in the
irrigation infrastructure.  Based on the combined contributions of all
5 participants in your group in each round, your group can maintain
the capacity of the irrigation infrastructure for growing crops.  \\


Before each round in this experiment you will have a chat period of 60
seconds where you can send text messages to the other participants.  

In this experiment you can only communicate with and observe the actions of your
immediate neighbors.  This will become more clear after we begin the practice round.


You may discuss any aspect of the exercise with two important
exceptions: You are not allowed to promise the other participants
side-payments or threaten them with any consequence after the
experiment is finished.  You are not allowed to reveal your real
identity.  We will be monitoring the chat traffic. If we detect any
violation of these rules, we will have to remove all members of the
group where the violation occurred from the experiment. That group
will have to wait until the entire experiment is finished to receive
payment. \\

We will now start a practice round to help illustrate the experiment. \\

These practice rounds will not contribute to your earnings.  They are only intended
to acquaint you with the functioning of the experimental environment.\\

\noindent{\bf[Explain investment table to subjects]}\\

At the beginning of each round, each participant will be given 10
tokens. You must then decide what to do with these tokens. You may
decide to invest some tokens  in the irrigation infrastructure or to keep
the tokens. For example, if you keep the tokens, you will earn 10
tokens in that round. On the other hand, if you invest some tokens in
the irrigation infrastructure, you may be able to earn more than this
amount by growing crops. In fact, by growing crops you can triple your
earnings compared to doing nothing. But note that the actual earnings
depend on what you and the other participants in the experiment do.

You now see a table summarizing the results of group investment. The
infrastructure had an efficiency of 50\% and you as a group invested
35. Now the infrastructure is 85\%.  Reading to the left where the
yellow line hits the red, stair-stepped curve, shows the water
delivery capacity, in this case 40 cfps.  The blue line shows the
amount of water available - in this case, 30 cfps.\\

In the diagram on the right you see how much your immediate neighbors contributed to
the public infrastructure.  Example:  If you are in position C, you will see the
contributions of participants in positions B and D.  If you are in position A, you
will only see the contributions of the participant in position B.

There are FIVE participants, each of which is randomly assigned to one
of the five positions, A, B, C, D or E. Water comes from the box to the
left and the five players are located from upstream to downstream. To
illustrate the game, assume you are in position A. The black lines
represent gates that you control (i.e open and close).  Right now,
your gate is closed, and player B's gate is open.\\

If you were in position C, you would only see the information for your neighbors, positions B and D.

Each round will take 50 seconds and the amount of time left in the
round is indicated at the top of the screen.\\

During this round you can irrigate your field. The earnings depend on
the amount of water you put on your field as will be explained in the
next screen. How fast you can grow a crop depends only on the amount
of water that is available to you. The maximum flow capacity of the
main canal shared by A, B, C, D, and E is 40 cubic feet per second
(cfps).\\

The actual amount of water that is available for the group depends on
the amount of water entering the system. Your group might have created
an irrigation infrastructure with a capacity of 40 cfps, but due to
lack of rainfall only 30 cfps is available. On the other hand, if
infrastructure capacity is 30 cfps and 40 cfps of water is available
to the system, only 30 cfps can be delivered.  The maximum capacity
that can flow through your gate when it is opened is 25 cubic feet per
second. If other people are using the canal, the water flow available
to you might be less, and it may take longer to get water to your
field.\\

The water flow capacity available for your field is shown as a number.
If somebody upstream uses water, less water is available for you. The
thickness of the blue bar is the relative amount of water available.
To start growing crops, click on the large button ``open your
gate''. This will open your irrigation gate and water will begin to
flow to your field. The text on the button will turn to ``close your
gate''. If you would like to close the gate, click on the yellow
button again. The gate closes and the text on the button returns back
to ``open your gate''.  The amount of water units (cubic feet) your
field has received is shown on the screen, as well as the resulting
amount of tokens earned from growing a crop.  The number of tokens
earned in each round depends on how much water you have diverted to
your field. If you receive less than 150 cubic feet (cf) the crop has
not received enough water to grow a crop and you will thus not receive
any tokens. The maximum earnings are received when between 500 cf and
549 cf are diverted to your field. If more than 549 cf water is
diverted to your field, this will negatively affect the growth of the
crop (i.e. overwatering) and less tokens will be earned. In the graph
in the right bottom of the screen you can see the amount of tokens
earned as a result of the amount of water
applied to your field.\\

Your earnings at the end of the round depend on your investment and
the number of tokens received for the crop. We will now start a crop
season for 50 seconds. Just try out what happens when you open and
close the gate on your earnings.  See the table on your handout.\\

\noindent{\bf[TELL ALLEN: START 50 SECOND CROPPING ROUND]} \\


You see now a table summarizing how much you and other group members have earned
if this round was for real. You see how much you have invested or not,
and how many tokens you earned from growing a crop. \\

If you have any questions feel free to raise your hand and to ask your
question. Do you have any questions so far?\\

We will now ask you to answer a number of quiz questions which gives
us a better idea how well you understood the instructions. \\


\noindent{\bf Instructions for Round 11 - Treatment 1} \\

In the past rounds the infrastructure efficiency declined from
one round to the next at a constant amount of 25\%. In the
following rounds the average decline of the infrastructure
efficiency will remain the same, but the actual amount of
decline can vary from round to round. This means that in some
rounds the decline will be larger than 25\% and some rounds the
decline will be smaller than 25\%. Before each round begins you
will continue to make a decision on how much to invest in the
irrigation infrastructure. After all of your investment
contributions have been submitted the resulting level of
infrastructure efficiency will be displayed and then the round
will begin. If you have any questions, please ask them now.
