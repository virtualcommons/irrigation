<h3>Round 11 Instructions</h3>
<p>
In the past rounds the infrastructure efficiency declined from one round to
the next at a constant amount of 25%. In the following rounds the <b>average
decline</b> of the infrastructure efficiency will remain the same, but the
<b>actual amount</b> of decline can vary from round to round. This means that
in some rounds the decline will be larger than 25% and some rounds the decline
will be smaller than 25%. Before each round begins you will continue to make a
decision on how much to invest in the irrigation infrastructure.  After all of
your investment contributions have been submitted the resulting level of
infrastructure efficiency will be displayed and then the round will begin.  If
you have any questions, please ask them now.
