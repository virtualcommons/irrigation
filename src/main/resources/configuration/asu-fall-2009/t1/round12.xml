<h3>Round 11 Instructions</h3>
<p>
This is round 11/20.  
</p>
<p>
In the past 10 rounds the infrastructure efficiency declined from one round to the
next at a constant rate of 25%. In the following 10 rounds the average decline of
the infrastructure efficiency remains the same, but the amount of decline can vary
from round to round. This means that in some rounds the decline will be larger than 25%
and some rounds the decline will be smaller than 25%.  Before each round begins you
will continue to make a decision on how much to invest in the irrigation
infrastructure.  After all of your investment contributions have been submitted the
resulting level of infrastructure efficiency will be displayed and then the round
will begin.  If you have any questions, please ask them now.
</p>

The infrastructure has been degraded by 10%.
