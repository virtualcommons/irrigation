<h3>Round 11 Instructions</h3>
<p>
In the past rounds the water supply was stable at a level of 30 cubic
feet per second for each round. In the following rounds the average water
supply remains 30 cfps, but the actual water supply varies each round
between 25 cfps and 35 cfps. After you have made your investment decisions,
the infrastructure level is announced as well as the actual water supply for
that round.  Please remember that the water supply is independent of your
irrigation capacity.  If you develop an irrigation capacity of 30 cfps but the
water supply is only 20 cfps, you are only getting 20 cfps down your canal.
