<h3>Round 1 Instructions</h3>
<p>
This is the first round of twenty.  Before this round begins you will have the
opportunity to text chat with the other participant for fifty seconds, then
decide on your level of investment in the irrigation infrastructure.  After
the total irrigation infrastructure investment has been determined you will

and grow crops.
