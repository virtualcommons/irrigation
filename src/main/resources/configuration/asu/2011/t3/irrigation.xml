<h1>Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
You have already earned {showUpPayment} by showing up for this exercise. You
can earn more, up to a maximum of about {maximumPayment}, by participating in this
experiment which will take about an hour to an hour and a half. The amount of money
you earn depends on your decisions AND the decisions of other people in this room
over the course of the experiment.
</p>
<h2>Groups</h2>
<hr>
You will be participating in this exercise as a part of a group of
{self.clientsPerGroup} participants. Your group has been formed by randomly
selecting you and four other participants in the room. 
</p>
<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This exercise mimics decisions people make in irrigation systems. In each round you will receive {self.tokenEndowment}
tokens.  You can choose to invest in the irrigation infrastructure or keep the tokens. Based on the <b>water delivery
capacity</b> of the irrigation infrastructure and the availability of water you will be able to grow crops. The total
number of tokens you can earn in a round is the sum of your tokens not invested plus the tokens you earn from growing
crops. Each token is worth {dollarsPerToken}. In each round you will first decide how much to invest in the irrigation
infrastructure.  Based on the combined contributions of all 5 participants in your group in each round, your group can
maintain the capacity of the irrigation infrastructure for growing crops. 
</p>

<p>
We will now start a practice round to help illustrate the experiment.  Before each
round in this experiment you will have a chat period of {self.chatDuration} seconds
where you can send text messages to the other participants. 
{self.restrictedVisibilityInstructions}

You may discuss any aspect of the exercise with two important exceptions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>You are <b>not allowed</b> to promise the other participants
side-payments or threaten them with any consequence after the experiment is
finished.
</li>
<li>You are <b>not allowed to reveal your real identity</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We will be monitoring the chat traffic.  If we detect any violation of these rules,
we will have to remove <b>all members of the group where the violation occurred</b>
from the experiment. That group will have to wait until the entire experiment is
finished to receive payment.

<h2>Quiz</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The first two questions deal with irrigation infrastructure investment.  
<b>Please refer to Table 1 of your handout</b>.
</p>
<form>
<p>Question 1:<br>
Given an existing infrastructure efficiency of 20%, if the five participants invest
a <b>total of 29 additional tokens</b>, what is the new irrigation infrastructure
efficiency?<br>
<input type="text" name="q1" value = "">%
</p>
<p>Question 2:<br>
Suppose the infrastructure efficiency in the last round was 60%.  For the current
round, the efficiency will decline by an amount of 25% for a resulting
infrastructure efficiency of 35%.  If the members of your group invest a total of 15
tokens, what will be your group's resulting water delivery capacity?<br>
<input type="text" name="q2" value = ""> cubic feet per second
</p>
<p>
The next two questions deal with the capacity of the irrigation system in relation
to the actual amount of water available.
</p>
<p>
Question 3:<br>
If the irrigation efficiency is between 71 and 80%, the water delivery capacity of
the irrigation system is 35 cubic feet per second.  Suppose the water supply
available to your group is 30 cubic feet per second and A opens their gate,
diverting water at 25 cubic feet per second.  What is the available water flow for
B?
<br>
<input type='text' name='q3' value=''> cubic feet per second
</p>
<p>Question 4:<br>
If the available water delivery capacity is 25 cubic feet per second and A, B, C,
and D are not using water, how much cubic feet of water per second is available for
E?<br>
<input type='text' name='q4' value=''> cubic feet per second
</p>
<p>
The final two questions cover the number of tokens you can earn in within a round.
<b>Please refer to Table 2 of your handout</b>.
</p>
<p>Question 5:<br>
If you invest 7 of the 10 tokens you start with and you apply 202 cubic feet of
water to your fields, what is the total number of tokens you will have earned at the
end of the round?<br>
<input type="text" name="q5" value="">tokens
</p>
<p>Question 6:<br>
If you invest all 10 tokens you start with and you apply 555 cubic feet of water to
your fields, what is the total number of tokens you will have earned at the end of
the round?<br>
<input type="text" name="q6" value="">tokens

<hr>
<p>
You have been endowed with {self.tokenEndowment} tokens to invest. You must make a decision about
how much you wish to invest in the irrigation infrastructure by choosing a number
between 0 and {self.tokenEndowment}.  You can see the relationship between total
investment and irrigation infrastructure in the table below.  After you have entered
the number of tokens you'd like to invest, hit the enter key or click the submit
button to confirm your investment. When everybody has made their decision, the total
investment will be calculated and the overall irrigation infrastructure will be
displayed. Each token you invest corresponds to one percent of infrastructure
efficiency, so if you invest 10 tokens you are contributing 10% to the overall
infrastructure efficiency.
