<h3>Round 11 Instructions</h3>
<p>
In the past rounds the water availability was stable at a level of 30 cubic
feet per second for each round. In the following 10 rounds the <b>average water
supply</b> remains 30 cfps, but the <b>actual water supply</b> in each round
will vary between 20 cfps and 40 cfps. After you have made your investment
decisions, the infrastructure level will be displayed as well as the actual
water supply for that round.
