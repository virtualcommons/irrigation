<h3>Round {self.roundNumber} Instructions</h3>
<p>
This is the first actual round of the experiment.  Before this round begins you will
have the opportunity to text chat with the other participants in your group, then
decide on your level of investment in the irrigation infrastructure.  After the
total irrigation infrastructure investment has been determined you will begin the
experiment and make decisions on when to open your irrigation gates and grow crops.
